                    <td data-label="Context"> The world is now plugged in, and countries are connceted un using a mixtura of terrestrial networks, undersea cables, satellite and microware communications, Wi-Max and Wi-Fi, GSM and 3G. The move from packet-based services to the internet protocol means everyone expects to communicate voice, data and video from anywhere to anywhere, globally. The availability of wide area data services such as MPLS and Ethernet have spread all over the world, allowing companies to manage and comunicate with their operations wherever they may be.
                        A reason for this has been the fall in bandwidth costs, and broadband is getting cheaper and cheaper. Services can now deliver tens or even hundreds of megebits of bandwidth into individual homes for much less money than a 64Kb line that a whole factory might have used to run its operation only a few years ago.

                    <td data-label="Context">  In 1965 Gordon Moore stanted that the number of transistor on a chip would double about every two years. And that has more or less remained true since then. As we write, as single chip can hold about 1 billion transistor each making 3 billion binary calculations per second.
                        there has' been a huge increase in the volumen of data and data storange capacity requiered for this; secondly, there as been a significant decrease in the size and power consumpion of hardware and finally manufacturing costs are falling significantly. The result is that there are more and more powerful computers in our lives, and even handheld devices can store gigabytes of data holding thousands of MP3 music files or hundreds of films.

                    <td data-label="Context"> The internet is changing the way we access, buy and use applications. We go online and download the software we want onto our computer, like any other digital product. Increasingly we don't even have the software on our hardware, but visit an internet site and use of this software as a service (SaaS) model meanas that we may not need such powerful computers in the facture.
                        We have seen the impact of off-shoring and the rise of Indian as the world centre of software development and application management. We are also seeing some of the smartest applications and services coming out of people's bedrooms; more and more experts are producting Open Source software, which is becoming more and more popular, creating a real threat to the big corporations.
