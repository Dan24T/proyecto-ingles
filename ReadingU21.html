                        </br>
                        <br>Right now, retailers need to get to grips with the dawn of contactless payment
                    </br>
                            <br>In the past week there has been a raft of announcements and news on alternative payment
                        methods. Technologist everywhere are still convinced that they can come up with something better that cash for smaller transactions.
                </br>
                <br> The alternative method that retailers must consider in the immediate future is contactless payment.
                        A few store in London have gone live with the Barclaycard Business contactless payment system
                        already, more that 1,000 other sites have signed up to use it, and 3,000 consumers have
                        registered their interest in the system's OnePulse contactless card.
            </br><br>
                        A recent YouGov survey commissioned by an ATM operator highlighted that consumers have
                        fraud concerns about contactless payment. Yet similar surveys of online shopping also tend to
                        highlight significant fraud feas, while the number of people and volume of their online transactions
                        continues to grow.
        </br><br>
                        In the longer term, the techies are stull betting on the mobile phone becoming the new wallet.
                        PayPal has gone live with a mobile payment system already. Others are still very much a work in
                        progress; such as the mobile payment system dubbed GPay that it has emerged Google has filed a
                        patent for.
    </br><br>
                        Another, PayForlt, is a mobile payment scheme for transactions inder 10 that all five major mobile
                        network operators have signed up to. At present, it is only really being used to pay for mobile phone
                        content. However, the plan is to expand this so consumers can make payments to online retailers
                        when they access their sites via mobile phone.
</br><br>
                        If this seems far-fetched, just take a look at some of the retailers that have registered for .mobi
                        internet domains - a type of web sites address that highlights the fact that the site has been
                        optimised for viewing on a mobile device.
</br><br>
                        It is good practice to buy any domain that may pertain to your brand. However, it is interesting to
                        note that innovative retailers such as Amazon and Tesco have already secured domains that will
                        allow them to launch mobile-optimised sites, should they wish.
